# Flower Empower


## Project Overview


This is a group project where we made an online database and website for a charity in California that delivers flowers to people with long-term illnesses. 
We updated their volunteer management processes using automated email reminders, an online database of flower recipents and volunteers, and a routing system for the delivery drivers
